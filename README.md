# CLarbor
For computing dependency trees in linguistic typological data, Chu-Liu/Edmons arboresences - CLarbor.

This repository contains R scripts that define functions for computing dependency-sensitive distances for lingusitic typology and vizualise the results. The scripts are written by Siva Kalyan and Hedvig Skirgård. We provide a more extensive documentation [here](https://github.com/HedvigS/CLarbor/blob/master/CLarbor_doc.pdf).

For this repos, we have constructed a demo using data from the Sahul-survey of languages in Oceania and Australia. We are grateful to Michael Dunn and team for allowing us access to that data.  We would also like to thank Harald Hammarström for his invaluable guidance and support in the process of instansiating the Chu-Liu/Edmonds-algorithm.
